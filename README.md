My friends and I created this project to fulfill Code Reengineering Course Project at my university. 
ABC Cloth Shop Management System Application is a cloth shop management system application. The application 
has three features. First, the AddNewCloth Feature makes store owners can add new types of clothing that 
their store has into the application. Then, the ViewClothList Feature. With this feature, shop owners can 
see various clothes added to the application. In addition, there is the DeleteCloth Feature to delete clothes 
added to the app. This project code consists of smell code and refactored code. The background of this project 
was to help people to manage their cloth shop data. We had a little difficulty making the smell code. Thatâ€™s why 
we read documentation. Finally, it was an honor to know that we have successfully created this project and scored 
a perfect one, 100 out of 100 for this project.
